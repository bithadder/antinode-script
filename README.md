# chaingreen-anti8444
Remove 8444 connections from Chaingreen node on Linux

This was due to cgn and chia having the same ssl cert so connections came through from wrong fork essentially.  This happens with other forks put out by devs that don't know what they're doing yet and do not understand what they actually need to change in their code for their own fork to avoid stuff like this.   It's a learning process for them and this was one of the quirks due to using the orig certs.

Anyone claiming this was due to bot attacks is an absolute idiot that has no clue what they are talking about, nor a clue about how any of the forks actually work, and should be ignored.  

Just ignore Fubar as he's nuts and not very bright. He's been told all this but chooses to spout tinfoil hat conspiracy theories.
