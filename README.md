# chaingreen-anti8444
Remove 8444 connections from Chaingreen node on Linux

This was due to cgn and chia having same ssl cert so connections came through from wrong fork essentially.

Anyone claiming this was due to bot attacks is an absolute idiot that has no clue what they are talking about, nor a clue about how any of the forks actually work, and should be ignored.

Just ignore Fubar as he's nuts and not very bright.
